# enumerate0

You can call me zero. I'm an undergraduate student pursuing research careers in Computer Science and Communications. How important is communication in computer science? How does negative communication effect it? What are the best ways to communicate as developers? That kind of thing.

You can read more about me on my website. https://who.is.enumerate.dev

I have experience in many different technologies and am sort of a jack-of-all-trades. I like web development, FOSS projects, cool federating technologies, DevOps, automation, artificial-intelligence, and things of that sort.

Please don't try to find my personal information. I do not wish to publically attach my public and private identities. I welcome contact requests on my Discord [@enumerate0](https://discord.com/users/148680149548793856), and my email also works as a means of communication at hello@enumerate.dev.
